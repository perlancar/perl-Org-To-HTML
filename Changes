0.230   2018-05-05 (PERLANCAR)

0.14     2014-08-16 (SHARYANTO) - Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - [build] CLI scripts are now generated automatically using
           Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ScriptFromFunc. The plugin is still at 0.01 so the

          copy-pasteable to web forms (which sometimes interprets newlines as
